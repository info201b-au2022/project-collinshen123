## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
source("../source/chart1.R")
source("../source/Chart_state.R")
source("../source/Chart_races.R")
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
## Table:


## Plots:

Plot 1: Female Physical Activity Percentage vs Female Obesity Prevalence

```{r female_physical_activity, echo=FALSE}
plot(female_physical_activity)
```

```{r WhiteRates, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = WhiteRates) + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Prevalence, y = State)) +
  xlim(0, 100)
```

```{r updated_table4, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = updated_table4) + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = State, y = Prevalence, fill = Race), position = "dodge") + 
  ggtitle("Obesity across races grouped by state") + 
  ylim(0, 100)

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
