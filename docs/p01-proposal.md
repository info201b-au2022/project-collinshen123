**Abstract:**

In this project, we are concerned with the issue of obesity, specifically, the prevalence of the rates in the US. This topic is important because according to the data collected from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), more than 2 in 5 adults (42.4%) have obesity and almost 1 in 5 children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 (19.3%) have obesity. To address this concern we plan to analyze datasets to examine the many factors that contribute to this issue.

**Keywords:** 
obesity, economic status, geography, race

**Introduction:** 
“It is health that is the real wealth, and not pieces of gold and silver.” – Mahatma Gandhi. As obesity remains one of the main health and social issues in the US, why is it so important and why should we be concerned ? According to the CDC, annual obesity-related medical care costs in the United States, in 2019, were estimated to be nearly $173 billion dollars. Annual nationwide productivity costs of obesity-related absenteeism range between $3.38 billion ($79 per individual with obesity) and $6.38 billion ($132 per individual with obesity). Preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic services may all be included in direct medical costs. Lost productivity is included in indirect expenses associated with illness and mortality. Employee absences from work due to obesity-related health issues, decreased productivity at work, and early death and disability are all examples of productivity measurements. Another reason is military readiness, over one third of young adults (17–24) are too obese to join the US military. Only 3 out of 4 young adults who satisfy the weight standards report having levels of physical activity that equip them for the difficulties of basic training. As a result, just 2 in 5 young adults are sufficiently active and within the weight requirements for military service. Additionally, from 16% in 2015 to 19% of active-duty service personnel in 2020 were obese. These people are less likely to be in good health and be able to deploy. More than 3.6 million musculoskeletal injuries occurred to active-duty soldiers between 2008 and 2017. According to one study, obese active-duty troops had a 33% higher risk of suffering this kind of injury.

# **The Problem Domain:**

**Project framing:**
Referencing The New York Times, a study done by medical scientists, “…projected that by 2030, nearly one in two adults will be obese,” (Brody). The problem domain we are presenting concerns obesity in the U.S. and as it persists, the factors correlated to this issue. The main question that we strive to address is “What factors impact  the obesity levels in the U.S.?” Upon this, we will consider questions including: how does geography affect obesity, how does race/ethnicity influence obesity, and how does school funding impact childhood obesity rates/how does economic status affect obesity?

**Human Values:**
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), various studies have reported harmful stereotypes that those who are overweight or obese are, “lazy, weak-willed, unsuccessful, unintelligent, lack self-discipline, have poor willpower, and are noncompliant with weight-loss treatment,” (Puhl, Heuer). As a result of these stigmas, prejudice of obese individuals is commonly experienced in workplaces, health facilities, schools, and mass media. Once more referencing the NIH, “the prevalence of weight discrimination has increased by 66% over the past decade, and is now comparable to prevalence rates of racial discrimination in America.” While these opinions generally sprout from the notion that sustaining a healthy lifestyle is important, this should not deter from the fact that there are external factors that contribute to obesity which need to be addressed.

**Direct and Indirect Stakeholders:**
The direct stakeholders of this topic are the obese population in the US. As this project centers around this group and they are the ones living with this chronic health condition, this topic affects them the most directly. They may be interested in gaining information about the external components that are related to obesity. The indirect stakeholders are the ones who are not experiencing this health condition firsthand, but are associating themselves with the conversation either by obligation or choice. This includes health care facilities, mass media, workplaces, and schools.

**Potential Harms and Benefits:**
If interventions are taken with data and technology, a possible benefit could be bringing awareness and diminishing the harmful stigma that obesity is solely a choice. Rather than having this negative outlook, it should encourage the conversation of living a healthier lifestyle, one that includes a nutritious diet, exercise, and improvements on mental health. Furthermore, as stated by the BMC, “obese is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases including heart disease, cancer, kidney failure, pulmonary disease and diabetes,” thus needs to be addressed for preventative action (Pearce, et al.). However, acknowledging that data and technology simply presents data, this will not stop negative stereotypes. If the data shows that one ethnical or racial group has high percentages of obesity, this may create a stigma that this group as a whole is obese. This applies to the other variables as well such as socioeconomic status, region of residency, and age.

**Research Questions:**
1. How do exercise habits of adults influence obesity rates? What is the significance of getting exercise and by how much does it affect obesity and possibly other health issues? How would genetics and metabolism affect obesity? Even though these statistics are extremely hard to measure on a large scale, is there any data that suggests that some people have predispositions when it comes to having a genetically lower chance of having obesity.  
2. How does geography affect obesity? Since different regions of the United States have differing cuisines, does diet based on geographical location have a large enough influence on obesity in the US. Are certain diets more susceptible to obesity or other health problems such as Diabetes?
3. How does race/ethnicity affect obesity? The effects that Race and Ethnicity may most likely have are most closely linked to genetics. This question builds off of the first question on genetics and a person’s metabolism.
4. How does school funding impact childhood obesity rates? In lots of cases, schools do not serve very healthy lunches so this may have a correlation to obesity. These statistics are almost directly related to how much funding the school receives for providing meals. Similarly, how does Economic status affect obesity? A family’s ability to provide meals for their children also depends on their economic standing and how much they can afford for food.
How does childhood obesity affect adult obesity rates?

**The Dataset:**
Region vs Obesity Rates:  
The data comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an on-going state-based, telephone interview survey conducted by CDC and state health departments. Based on our small observation, we can conclude that this is the most reliable and interesting dataset to work with. The dataset below describes the obesity prevalence in 49 states(except for Florida), DC and 3 US territories in 2021, which shows us the self-reported adult obesity prevalence by region, ethnicity and race. The 2021 maps show that obesity impacts some groups more than others, which in our opinion leads to another factor - economic standing. There are notable differences across the states and territories, as shown by combined data from 2019–2021:
- All states and territories had more than 20% of adults with obesity.
- 20% to less than 25% of adults had obesity in the District of Columbia.
- 25% to less than 30% of adults had obesity in 8 states.
- 30% to less than 35% of adults had obesity in 22 states and Guam.
- 35% to less than 40% of adults had obesity in 17 states, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.
- 40% or more adults had obesity in 2 states (Kentucky and West Virginia).
- The South (36.3%) had the highest prevalence of obesity, followed by the Midwest (35.4%), the Northeast (29.9%), and the West (28.7%).  
- 
Increased BMI is one of the main risk factors for non-communicable diseases such as:

- cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke), which were the main cause of death in 2012
- diabetes
- disorders of the musculoskeletal system (especially osteoarthritis — an extremely disabling degenerative joint disease)
- some oncological diseases (including cancer of the endometrium, breast, ovary, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney and colon)
- The risk of these non-communicable diseases increases as the BMI increases.

Childhood obesity increases the likelihood of obesity, premature death and disability in adulthood. In addition to the increased risk in the future, obese children also experience shortness of breath, are at increased risk of fractures, are prone to hypertension, early signs of cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and may experience psychological problems.


**Expected Implications:** We expect the data to imply that communities with lower incomes experience higher rates of obesity, due to the fact that eating unhealthy processed foods in America has become significantly [cheaper than eating a balanced diet](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/healthy-vs-unhealthy-diet-costs-1-50-more/). We also suspect that historically marginalized groups of people (such as African Americans) will experience disproportionate rates of obesity because these groups usually have less access to healthy food and health resources. The data will most likely imply that factors that affect an individual’s economic status, such as race and location, are what affect a person’s likelihood of obesity.


**Limitations:**
There isn't one set factor that contributes to obesity. There are some factors such as having a high metabolism that vary from person to person. Genetic attributes like these are hard to gather data for. Another limitation is that there is not enough data to represent everyone in the US. Even if there was, it would be extremely hard for us to process all the data. Everyone’s body makeup is unique and there are different factors that can all contribute to obesity. This makes having more data a better representation of the US population.
